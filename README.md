## Bachelor Thesis Code Repository ##
This repository presents the code used in my bachelor thesis titled "Utilizing GLM-HMM Analysis of Behavioral Patterns to Identify Mental States in Mice Performing a Visual Perception Task".
The thesis was written under the supervision of Timo Stein, Umberto Olcese and with the support of Kengo Takahashi.

## Research ##
Two hypothesis were tested:
1. Distinct mental states in mice are present within a session  
   --> Distinct mental states were found within a session for all mice and all sessions analyzed.
3. Pupil dilations will correlate with the mice's mental states  
   --> The pupil pupil dilations did correlate but mixed relationships were found for each session.

## Workflow ##
The code processes data from both lick detectors (for behavioral data) and pupil videos (for pupil dilation) to model the transition probabilities of the miceâ€™s behavioral states under the influence of the presented stimuli.
It currently follows a 3-step workflow where first the states are generated by the GLM-HMM, then are manually identified by a human based on the performance metrics exported and lastly plots and export data are re-generated based on the states identified.

## Continuation of Work ##
The thesis was written as part of an research internship.
Coding- and computing-wise this code is not ideal. It will be refactored, improved and expanded in the following repository: [GLM-HMM-Analysis](https://github.com/FlorianKrauseResearch/GLM-HMM-Analysis)
